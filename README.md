# Time-tracking-dashboard

Solution to the [Time tracking dashboard challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Fetched data from JSON file
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The goal while building this project was to get along with CSS Grid.
I have learned CSS grid properties to span and shrink objects according to the main project design. It helped me to easily switch between mobile view and desktop view by only 2-3 CSS Grid properties and keep it responsive.

Main positions of HTML tags are styled using CSS Grid but also at some places with Flebox because i feel it easier to for example center elements and objects than with CSS Grid.
Additionally i was able to practice more of SCSS syntax to take advantage of spliting CSS code to modules with mixins and variables.

Another thing i find very usefull was my first contact with JSON file. I have managed to fetch data from it, pass it to the proper elements and display on the screen.
